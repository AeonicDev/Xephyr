#_Xephyr_
Xephyr is a plugin engine for Bukkit and Spigot servers, designed for ease of use and speedy development of custom plugins.

It contains many utilities only found in proprietary plugins for large servers, including "Special" items (as found on
custom Hunger Games servers), Inventory Menus (a better API than any public ones released so far), and an extremely extensive
command system.
